# pfFlanking
A mod for Baldur's Gate 3. Implement Pathfinder flanking rules. If an enemy is also threatened from the opposite side of their hitbox, gain a +2 to melee attack rolls. Requires Script Extender.

Developed for Patch 6, as that is what I am currently playing in a Co-op playthrough.

Below is the Pathfinder's PHB Flanking reference. This mod is not perfect as it implements the functionality based on relative distances rather than adjacent spaces. My goal with this mod is to enable additional ways to think about combat and reminisce on my college days playing Pathfinder (1e). Moving forward, I aim to implement this bonus for enemies as well with a configuration file to enable/disable that functionality.

MS Paint Reference, mostly for fun.

As this is my first-ever mod, I have a couple people to thank. This would have been much worse/longer/harder without them:

A big thank you to Muffin, Legendary Runeshaper! He is very active in the Larian Discord, answered all my modding questions, and gave a lot of insight into how I can troubleshoot/debug my mod. Check out his incredible work here: https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11437

Another thank you to Lunisole! They have been very helpful and are actively working on implementing additional features to their Backstabbing Framework to support proper flanking calculations! This framework has a lot of potential and I'm very excited to see how the community implements it, as well as its continued development. I also learned quite a lot by reviewing their work on this framework. Check it out: https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11741/
